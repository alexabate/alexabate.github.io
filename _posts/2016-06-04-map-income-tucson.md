# Hack for Change mapping project

4th June 2016 was [Code For America's "National Day of Civic
Hacking"](https://cache.codeforamerica.org/events/national-day-2016/) (or "Hack
for Change" which is more speak-able). Tucson's local event was held in the
University of Arizona's Science and Engineering library. The temperature in
Tucson had just popped over 100F, that day in particular was forecast to be
113F, so there never was a better day for staying indoors hacking with plenty of
air conditioning (and pizza).

Looking through the list of suggested projects I found the [Opportunity
Project](https://cache.codeforamerica.org/events/national-day-2016/challenge-
the-opportunity-project) particularly interesting because it involved taking
advantage of federal+local open data for social good. It also gave the chance to
investigate the [CitySDK](https://uscensusbureau.github.io/citysdk/guides.html)
tool that works as a wrapper around the various APIs required to grab the
different data sets available (census, FEMA, farmer's markets, etc).

We formed at team of 3 (Jon Eckel, Pete Lowe and myself) called JustMapIt!
(chosen to reflect our dedication to producing *something* by the end of the
day). We decided that creating a visualisation that mapped the population income
and/or poverty index across Tucson, along with access to grocery stores, may
yield something interesting and useful. First we began by checking out the
available data, making sure it contained data in the Tucson area!

The first major issue was that the CitySDK tool didn't appear to be working. In
the interest of time we decided to directly grab our own data sets instead.


## Data sets

* INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (IN 2014 INFLATION-ADJUSTED DOLLARS) from the
[2014 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates](http://factfinder.census.gov/)
data for Arizona
* Latitude and Longitude positions of grocery stores in Tucson scraped from
venues with categoryID='Grocery Store' in Foursquare using its API (and then
cleaned a little)

## The income data

This data set gives the number of households and median income per census tract.
Census tracts are small-ish, subdivisions of a county (or similar). Theys
provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of statistical
census data. Generally they contain a population size between 1,200 and 8,000
people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.

In the data below the columns `id` and `id2` contain the census tract id's. 

**In [41]:**

{% highlight python %}
# household income census data
income_df = pd.read_csv("income_census_data.csv", header=[0,1], dtype={0:str, 1:str})

{% endhighlight %}
 
## Munging

There were two levels of column labels so the dataframe columns were
multindexed. Since the upper level of labels gave no useful information, for
ease of use we removed them. 

**In [42]:**

{% highlight python %}
# remove secondary column label
levels = income_df.columns.levels
labels = income_df.columns.labels
income_df.columns = levels[1][labels[1]]

# quick look at data
income_df.head()

The output from `describe` looks odd though the data itself looks ok. Also an
error is raised on trying to plot it, with `hist`

    TypeError: len() of unsized object

or with `plot`

    ValueError: could not convert string to float:

{% endhighlight %}

    Median income = - Number of households = 0

 
There is one entry where there is a null value (`-`) for the median income, and
this corresponds to a census tract with 0 households (this seems to be because
this tract is a State Prison complex).
So we need to ignore the tract where number of households=0, and also convert
the data to floats (because its type is string).

## Folium for mapping

Folium is a python wrapper for the Leaflet javascript library, which itself can
render interactive maps.

We need a way to convert the census tract ID to its equivalent area on the map,
the census website provides this [data](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-
data/data/cbf/cbf_tracts.html) in the form of ESRI Shapefiles.

Folium works with GeoJSON files so we need to convert. Handily we can do this
using an [online converter](http://ogre.adc4gis.com/) 

**In [48]:**

{% highlight python %}
import folium
import json

# GeoJSON file of Arizona census tracts
state_geo = "arizona.json"

# initialize map
tucson_coords = [32.2,-110.94]
mp = folium.Map(location=tucson_coords, zoom_start=11)

# map data to geo_json
mp.geo_json(geo_path=state_geo, 
            data=income_df.ix[(income_df["Households; Estimate; Total"] > 0)],
            data_out="median_income.json", 
            columns=["Id2", "Households; Estimate; Median income (dollars)"],
            key_on="feature.properties.GEOID",
            fill_color='YlGn',
            fill_opacity=0.7,
            line_opacity=0.2 ,
            threshold_scale= np.logspace(np.log10(15000), np.log10(125000), 6).tolist(),
            legend_name='Median Income') 

# plot the supermarkets on the map
for i,row in supermarkets.iterrows():
    name = row["name"].decode("utf8")
    mp.circle_marker(location=[str(row["lat"]), str(row["lon"])], popup=name, radius=100, fill_color="red", )

# generate the HTML/Javascript
mp.create_map(path='tucson.html', plugin_data_out=False)
{% endhighlight %}
 
## Map!

Here is the [map](http://u.arizona.edu/~abate/arizona.html). Unfortunately we
ran out of time before being able to add a toggle to toggle between median
income and another dataset (e.g. population density). This particular
visualisation would also be served better by higher resolution income data than
that given by census tracts, but it was a great start: we learned a lot and
finished *something*!
