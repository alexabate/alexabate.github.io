#Generating galaxies using PCA and Gaussian Process

Galaxies have a wide range of colors depending on the kinds of stars that make
them up, the ages of those stars, and properties of dust in the interstellar
space. And probably a bunch of other stuff too. However although there is
technically an infinite possible number of galaxy spectra, there are not
limitless possibilities since the distribution of emitted flux with wavelength
depends upon a set of well-defined physical processes determined by star
formation and atomic physics.

Given some galaxy color (ratio of its flux at adjacent wavelengths), we want to
simulate its probable underlying galaxy spectrum, and one that is drawn from a
continuous distribution. We need some way of defining this distribution such
that it can produce any possible galaxy spectrum, but never an unphysical galaxy
spectrum (i.e. one that cannot be produced by radiation from stars+dust).

We have an idea of what the range of galaxy spectra in the universe are like so
we start from a set of discrete galaxy spectra we think (assume) roughly span
the real range of galaxy spectra.

Plotted below is the set of discrete galaxy spectra I will use.

Each one of these discrete spectra has colors associated with it (color is the
ratio of integrated flux within two neighboring wavelength regions). Given any
"real" set of galaxy colors we want to produce a likely underlying spectrum.



The color is estimated from the flux within a series of filters that define the
wavelength regions (for this case these are plotted below).

We want to define a relationship between the "observable", the galaxy colors,
and the spectrum we wish to predict.

It is a natural choice to decompose the spectra into a representative basis of
"eigenspectra" using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This is because in the
simplest sense a galaxy spectrum is just a sum of different spectra of stars.
The distribution of galaxy spectra could be then defined by the distribution of
eigenvalue sets corresponding to the different eigenspectra, as derived from our
set of discrete spectra.

We then need to make a mapping between color and a particular set of eigenvalues
in order to reconstruct a galaxy spectrum given any set of galaxy colors. We
don't know what functional form this mapping relationship might take, and
ideally we don't want to restrict any model options, or be too flexible and
allow for over-fitting that would render the derived mapping useless for any
galaxies not within the original discrete set of spectra.

The [Gaussian Process](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/) is a
Bayesian method that assigns a set of prior probabilities to every possible
function (e.g. higher probabilities to smooth functions, Occam's razor) that
could explain some observed data. The problem becomes tractable because you
require estimates of the functional form only at particular points in the
variable space (in this case galaxy colors). Once the prior probabilities for
the set of functions are confronted with data points, their combination leads to
a posterior distribution for the functions. It is the statistical properties of
the resulting posterior distribution that supply the inference of the output
(here eigenvalue set) given new input variables (here galaxy colors).

A covariance function used in the Gaussian Process decides the form the prior
probabilities will take, by defining the  shape of the prior probability
distribution, and having a characteristic length scale to control quickly the
prior probability changes over the function space. The covariance function is a
function of the input variables. I think this is what makes the problem
tractable, because the computation required is just the inversion of a matrix
that is the size of the dimensionality of the data set.

This method is not my idea and an original implementation can be found
[here](https://github.com/jbkalmbach/spectraPCA).

Plotting the first two eigenvalues shows that eigenvalue 1 gives a strong
indication of galaxy color. A galaxy is "redder" if the "color" value is larger,
and "bluer" if the value is smaller.

Very roughly a "blue" galaxy is star-forming and a "red" is old and no longer
forming stars.

Now let's do a test where we retrain the Gaussian process after removing one of
the spectra, then try to see how well it reconstructs the missing spectrum.

The blue solid line is the true spectrum, the dashed red is the reconstructed
spectrum and the dotted mean is the mean over the 129 spectra.

The reconstruction works pretty well.
