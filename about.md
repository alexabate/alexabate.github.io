Welcome to My So-Called Research Life (with minimal Jared Leto), that I have `so-called' DataDive.

I hope it embodies the spirit of the dive bar: does the job, is not super sophisticated, sometimes a little bit rough, and you definitely shouldn't eat here. Unlike a dive bar though, I should always be able to recall what has happened here.
